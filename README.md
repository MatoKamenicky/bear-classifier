# Bear Image Classifier 🐻

This project is a simple image classification demo using the [fastai] library. And it is based on tutorials from fastai (https://course.fast.ai/).
It downloads images of **grizzly bears**, **black bears**, and **teddy bears** from DuckDuckGo, trains a model, and classifies new bear images!

## Project Overview

- 📥 Search and download bear images from DuckDuckGo.
- 🖼️ Create an image dataset with 3 classes: Grizzly, Black, and Teddy bears.
- 🤖 Train a deep learning model with `fastai`'s vision module.
- 📈 Evaluate and test the model.

## Technologies Used
